We made three sketches to demo the most important Makar concepts…but this project was mostly about creating the framework (so that it’s easy to make awesome stuff later), so don’t expect super snazzy stuff.

1. Cube chair - click the real chair and a cubey virtual chair forms from the chaos
2. Typewriter - an AR rotating notepad that shows the messages entered from everyone in real-time
3. LSD Cubes - trippy flashing cubes are thrown from the windows of a Barcelonan building, showing off the scene mapping stuff
