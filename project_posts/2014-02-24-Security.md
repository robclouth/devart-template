Since this project relies on running untrusted 3rd-party code, even though it’s really really unlikely that someone will use this to hijack your phone, it’s probably best to take some security measures. After a quick search I found [Java-Sandbox](http://blog.datenwerke.net/p/the-java-sandbox.html), a library for running untrusted code in a secure environment that restricts the things it can do, e.g. delete everything on the phone. 
Once the context (the permissions) has be defined, it shouldn’t be too hard to use:

```
String pw = service.restrict(context);
try{
    /* put untrusted code here */
} finally {
    service.releaseRestriction(pw);
} 
```

This isn’t a huge priority though - there are much more fun things to do with first.
