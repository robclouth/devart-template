## Description
Imagine a second space that overlays reality, a creative space filled with digital artworks that augment their real surroundings. Seamlessly integrated, the environment is transformed into a playground to be explored. A brick wall becomes a musical step sequencer, a billboard in the metro station becomes a collaborative drawing canvas, the skyscrapers transform into beautiful glowing pillars of light that play notes when touched. A place where the boundary between the real and the virtual becomes fuzzy. This is the power of augmented reality, but tapping into its potential can be overwhelming for less technically-minded artists. 

Makar is an attempt to fix this, consisting of a set of user-friendly tools for the authoring and viewing of interactive augmented-reality artworks. The main tools are an Android app for viewing the artworks and assisting with augmentation, and a Processing library and toolset for creating the works themselves.
